## **2.0 CURRENT FUNCTIONS**
- [ ] **TODO** Update after CLI is written

## **3.0 INSTRUCTIONS**
- [ ] **TODO** Update after CLI is written for use on different machines
  
## **4.0 FUTURE DIRECTIONS**
### 4.1 CLI list of features
- [x]  Generate List of Tradeable Tokens
- [x]  Calculate APY of tradeable tokens
- [ ]  Calculate APY of only a selected token
- [ ]  Filter out bad tradeable tokens
- [ ]  Separate functions out into individual pieces
- [ ]  Compare old token list to new one
- [ ]  Update tradeable token list
- [ ]  Calculate APY over different timeframes
- [ ]  Compare APYs from different ranges of the same timeframes to give consistent earners

### 4.2 Long Term Features
- [ ] Create a website which displays results of queries
- [ ] Look into how to run python scripts through React
- [ ] Look into restricting access of tools through NFT ownership
  

## **5.0 DEVELOPER NOTES**
<p>This script is FAR from being complete, but currently it does provide a basic functionality. As it sits, the script:
</p>
1. Provides users with a list of all tokens <br>
2. Provides users with a list of all tradeable tokens <br>
3. Provides users with APY of provided token <br>
4. Provides users with APY of all tokens

<p>In order to provide this function to the public, I'll be first writing the scripts and desired functions, consolidating needed functions into primary calls which the CLI will utilize. From there, I'll create a website in react which will use this CLI in order to run the commands and display the data as requested. </p>
<p>After writing out this function, it will then be required to move into the next part of full stack development, which will be learning how to incorperate python into react.</p>
